Proxying API Requests in Development
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/
To tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, 
add a proxy field to your package.json, for example:

"proxy": "http://localhost:4000",

This way, when you fetch('/api/todos') in development, the development server will recognize 
that itâ€™s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to http://localhost:4000/api/todos 
as a fallback. The development server will only attempt to send requests without text/html in its 
Accept header to the proxy.
